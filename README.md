Script to enumerate subdomains, leveraging recon-ng:
 
Usage:

./enumall.sh google.com

Recon-ng is awesome. Recon-ng supports the use of resource scripts to automate the console.Â While having a resource script template for recon-ng is nice, it's cumbersome to have to change the template and domain constantly, or do it from the CLI.

This is my version of a script that dynamically creates a resource file for a domain and runs specified recon-ng modules on it. In this case it's for subdomain discovery but, it can be extended to any set of modules.

TLDR; I just want to do my subdomain discovery via ONE command and be done with it.

Some fast BASH-fu will do nicely here!
